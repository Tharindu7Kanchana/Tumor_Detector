# Tumor_Detector
This project is about detecting Brain tumors from MRI images using an interface of GUI in Matlab. Using the GUI, this program can use various combinations of segmentation, filters, and other image processing algorithms to achieve the best results This allows us to use various combinations of filters, and other image processing techniques to arrive at the best result that can help us detect brain tumors in their early stages.
Tools & Technologies - Image Processing, Matlab, Matlab GUI
